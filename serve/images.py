"""serve/images.py - image generation (Qwen-Image-2.1-Turbo, Qwen-Image-2.1, Mage-Flow) through XeStrata's own image
engine, strata-image.

POST /v1/images/generations takes OpenAI's request shape (prompt, size, n, response_format b64_json|url) plus Strata's
own field seed; POST /v1/images/edits the same with reference images (OpenAI's multipart form, image or image[]; or JSON
with images: [{"image_url": ...}]), which the image model edits or takes as its subject (Qwen-Image-2.1's edits: the
vision encoder reads them into the prompt, the VAE's encoder into the DiT's).  The engine (src/image/strata_image.cpp,
`strata-image --serve`) starts with the first image and stays, outside the server (serve/image_daemon.py, the next
server of the same image model and GPU finds it: a model switch does not lose it): its kernels built once, the
prompt's text states and the layers that fit in VRAM kept between images, one image a request.  It runs Turbo's
8 steps (CFG 1, the Euler flow sampler, the model's own sigmas), the image the one stable-diffusion.cpp makes with the
model card's command for the same seed (within LPIPS 0.03); the base model ("schedule": "base") the steps asked for
(default the config's "steps", 40) on its scheduler's sigmas (base_sigmas), CFG 1 as well.  A size whose sides are
not multiples of 16 (1920x1080) is made at the sides rounded up (1920x1088) and its middle cut out.

Mage-Flow ("family": "mage-flow", "schedule": "mage"): its own prompt form (MF_PROMPT_HEAD, the 34 ids of its system
turn dropped), the steps asked for (default the config's: Turbo 4, the RL model 20, the base model 30) on its static
shift (mage_sigmas), and guidance by guidance_scale or true_cfg_scale (the one scale it has; default the config's
"cfg_scale": Turbo 1, none; the others 5.0) with negative_prompt (default " ", its pipeline's).  Its edits take up to
MF_MAX_REFS reference images, in its edit form (MF_EDIT_HEAD, "Image j: <pad>" before the instruction, the 64 ids of
the system turn dropped) and the config's "edit_steps" (its edit models': Turbo 4, the others 30), on its edit DiT
("edit_model"); masks and transparent images it has none of.

The GPU is shared with the text engine one job at a time: an image job takes the service's turn (the FIFO every chat
request takes), so no chat turn runs on the GPU meanwhile.  The image engine works in the VRAM it is given: what it
holds and what is free, less a reserve; layers that do not fit are streamed from RAM, so it runs, more slowly, in a few
GB.  Before each job it says what the image needs (NEED: the least, and the DiT resident with the VAE in one piece),
and the config's "gpu_policy" says what happens to the text engine during the job (gpu_turn):
  keep    - it stays loaded and idle (an APU's shared memory, a card with room for both)
  shrink  - an engine started with --vram-elastic gives the image job VRAM from its expert cache and takes it back
            afterwards (POST /v1/vram's mechanism; the conversation stays in the engine)
  unload  - its conversation is saved to a session file, the engine is stopped, and the next start restores it
  auto    - (default) keep when the image fits beside it at full speed, else shrink when the engine can, else keep
            when the image fits at all (its layers streamed) and the RAM available holds the image model's files
            besides (ram_short), else unload: streamed beside the text engine with too little RAM, the image read
            its layers from the disk and pushed the text engine's experts out of RAM (decode 88 -> 11 tok/s on a
            PC with 28 GB of RAM, 2026-10-17)
After a job the image engine keeps what it holds (the next image starts warm) only under keep with VRAM to spare;
otherwise it lets go of everything but its process (about 200 MiB).  The daemon ends after daemon_idle_s (default
1800) without a server.

The config's "images" section (written by setup --images, tools/image/qimage.py):

   "reload": "lazy"|"eager", "max_n": 4, "max_side": 2048, "timeout_s": 3600, "uma": false, "out_dir": null,
   "keep_files": 64,
   "vision": "...mmproj-F16.gguf", "max_refs": 10, "reserve_mib": 512, "spare_mib": 1024, "ssd_offload": false,

                     "ram_left_gb": 14.0}}
  schedule: Turbo's own sigmas or the base model's (base_sigmas; no "schedule" is Turbo); steps: the base model's
  default (a request's "steps", 2 to MAX_STEPS, overrides it); vision: Qwen3-VL's vision encoder (mmproj), for the
  edits (without it they are refused); max_refs: the reference images an edit takes at most; reserve_mib: VRAM the
  image engine leaves free when it sizes itself; spare_mib: the free VRAM that must remain after a job under keep for
  the engine to keep its layers; quant_lowered (only when setup lowered them): the sizes setup took instead of the ones
  asked for, because the RAM the text model leaves was short (note(): the server's log and the web page say so).
