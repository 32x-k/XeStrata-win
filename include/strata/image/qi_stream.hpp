// include/strata/image/qi_stream.hpp - a component's layers (the DiT's blocks, the text encoder's layers) on the GPU
// within a budget: the first layers that fit stay in VRAM, the rest go through two slots, each copied while the layer
// before it computes.
//
// A layer is a list of host spans (the tensors in the mapped file) copied into one device region.  The copy goes from
// the file's pages (the page cache: nothing is held in RAM for it) through a pinned relay buffer of the largest layer
// by DMA on a copy stream; a slot is reused once the compute stream has passed the layer that used it.  The layers
// are taken in order, as the DiT and the encoder walk them (the next streamed layer is fetched when one begins), so
// keeping a prefix resident and cycling the rest is what a budget below the whole can do best: an LRU cache over a
// cyclic walk misses every time.
