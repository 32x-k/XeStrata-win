// include/strata/spec/draft_policy.hpp - per verify round: the MTP's window, or a lookup (suffix) window?
//
// The suffix drafter (prompt lookup) proposes the tokens that followed an earlier repeat of the context. Taken
// whenever it proposes more than the MTP, it lost 2-8% on ordinary text: a long lookup window costs much more to
// verify than the MTP's usual 3-4 tokens, and it is only worth that when enough of it is accepted. llama.cpp's
// lookup decoding answers the same problem with confidence thresholds on its n-gram statistics; here the policy
// learns both sides online and compares expected committed tokens per millisecond:
//
//   MTP     E = the mean tokens a window of that size has committed (EMA), at the measured cost of that size
//   lookup  E(k) = 1 + q + q^2 + ... + q^k for k <= the proposal, q = the acceptance rate of lookup drafts whose
//           match was about as long (4 buckets of match length, decayed counts), at the measured cost of k + 1
//
// and takes the lookup window only when its best E/cost beats the MTP's by `margin`. Costs are the measured round
// times per window size (EMA; sizes not seen yet are scaled from seen ones by a prior shape), so the policy adapts
// to the machine and the context length. It only chooses which drafts to verify: the output is unchanged.
