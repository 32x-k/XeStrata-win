"""Build intel/llvm's DPC++ (free software: Apache-2.0 with LLVM exceptions) from source into .tools/intel-llvm/, for a
free build of the engine where the distribution has no DPC++, or one whose SYCL runtime does not give the GPU its
matrix engines (Ubuntu 26.04's 6.2 lists none for the Arc Pro B70; intel/llvm added it in v7.0.0).

    tools/intel_llvm_build.py --windows [--xwin DIR] [--rebuild] [--keep-build] [--tag TAG]

.tools/intel-llvm/src is the clone, build/ the build tree, install/ the toolchain (bin/clang++, lib/libsycl.so).
Where ROCm's HIP is installed (free software), it builds the HIP target (AMD GPUs) as well, with ROCm's device
libraries built by the same compiler (DEVICE_LIBS_TAG, below).  --contrib builds the same
clone with the CUDA target too (NVIDIA GPUs; it needs NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit, which is not free software: the contrib
build mode), into .tools/intel-llvm-contrib/ (build/, install/).  --windows cross-builds the SYCL runtime for Windows
from the same clone, with the --contrib toolchain's tools, into .tools/intel-llvm-win/ (a Windows engine's headers,
import libraries and DLLs).  A finished install/ carries XESTRATA.json (the tag,
its commit, the date, the GPUs' matrix engines as tools/xmx_probe.cpp saw them).  Run again, it uses a finished install
of the same tag as it is, asks before building another tag over an older one, and continues an interrupted build where
it stopped.  build/ is deleted once install/ is done, unless --keep-build: keeping it makes the next tag's build
incremental.  v7.1.1 built in 13 minutes on 28 threads and keeps 3.5 GB (the clone 2.8, install/ 0.7).

Prints the toolchain's folder on its last line.  setup.py runs it for --intel-llvm-build."""
