# XESTRATA_JOBS=N compiles N files at once in every build in the container (default: as many as the threads;
# intel/llvm's links as many as the free RAM allows).
#
# The input is the commit alone (git archive; HEAD unless named, and then the work tree must be clean): nothing of
# the work tree's builds goes in.  The container starts from the distribution's image (its digest below), installs
# the build tools, builds intel/llvm, the image encoders and the engine, and runs CPack (tools/package/container.sh);
# it gets no GPU and nothing of this PC's, and is removed afterwards.  Only build/pkg/<distro>-<variant>/ comes out:
# the packages and BUILDINFO (the commit, the image, the packages the build had).  Rootless, the container's root is
# this user, so what it writes to the mounted folders is this user's.
#
# windows builds the Windows 7z in the same way, in Ubuntu 26.04's image (tools/package/windows.sh): all of it
# cross-built on Linux, intel/llvm's SYCL runtime for Windows included.  Its downloads that do not change between builds
# (the MSVC CRT and Windows SDK xwin fetches, NuGet's packages) are kept in build/pkg-cache/windows/; it shares the
# Ubuntu packages' compiler cache.
#
# The one thing kept between builds is the compiler cache, build/pkg-ccache/<distro>/ (ccache, one per distribution
# as their compilers differ; at most XESTRATA_CCACHE_MAX, default 30G): a package built after another of the same
# distribution takes most of intel/llvm's and the engine's objects from it.  Deleting the folder makes the next
# build compile everything again.
