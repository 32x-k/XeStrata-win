"""The serve table of an upstream merge on one GPU: XeStrata and upstream's release run as the server runs them
(`strata --serve`, the options setup writes), one chat of four turns per run: the tier's prompt, then the three
follow-ups of sync_prompts.py, each with the answer before it, 256 tokens a turn.  bench_generate.py measures the
generate path; this one the serve loop users meet (the conversation checkpoints, the per-request sampling, its own
decode loop).  The engines are driven over stdin (GEN, DONE), not through serve/server.py.  The runs are
tools/bench_core.py's (ab_serve), which setup's --bench makes too.

    XE="CMD..." UP="CMD..." DATA=DIR IDS=DIR XE_PROFILE=... UP_PROFILE=... \\
      python .claude/skills/upstream-sync/scripts/bench_serve.py OUT GPU [--dry-run]

XE, UP, XE_PROFILE, UP_PROFILE, DATA, IDS, CONFIG, PACK, NATIVE, PLE, EXTRA and TIERS (default "64k 32k 1k") as for
bench_generate.py; a wrapper command must pass stdin through (podman run -i).  MODES (default "greedy t07"): greedy,
and tNN = temperature NN / 10 (t07 = 0.7, t10 = 1.0), top_p 0.95, top_k 20, a seed per round.  ROUNDS (default 3):
runs per arm, tier and mode, each a new process, the arms alternating; one discarded warm-up per arm first.  No
--spec-follow: serve has none, so each engine writes its own text and the drafts it accepts count in its output
speed, as they do for a user.
OUT/serve-runs/GPU-ARM-TIER-MODE-ROUND.txt gets each run's log, and .json the four turns' DONE fields;
sync_collect.py OUT reads them.  An upstream run whose first turn reads its prompt or writes its output at SLOW tok/s
or less (default 10) is not run again in that tier and mode (marked "stopped"); a run past 2400 s is killed.
--dry-run: print the engine commands instead of running them.
