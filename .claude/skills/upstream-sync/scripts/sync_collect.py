"""Reads bench_generate.py's OUT/runs/*.txt and writes OUT/matrix.json (every run) and, per GPU, the prompt and output
tables (the median of the rounds; a cell no run finished is "-", one stopped as too slow "too slow") as Markdown to
stdout.  An upstream run stopped as too slow has "stopped" (prompt or output); one stopped in its output takes its
prompt rate from the last PP line (or, without PP lines, from its "strata generate: prefill" line).
When bench_serve.py ran too, OUT/serve-runs/*.json go to OUT/matrix-serve.json and three more tables per GPU and mode:
the tier's prompt, the follow-ups (the median time a follow-up's prompt takes, in ms) and the output of all four
turns.
When bench_usage.py ran too, OUT/usage-runs/*.json go to OUT/matrix-usage.json and a table per GPU: per conversation,
the time to the first token (the median of its turns), the prompt and the output speed (the server's timings, summed).
The reading is tools/bench_core.py's (collect).
